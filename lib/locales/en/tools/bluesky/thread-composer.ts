    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.q2": "How do I post a thread on Bluesky?",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.a2": "Post the first message, then reply to yourself with each subsequent post. Some third-party clients let you compose threads more easily. The 🧵 emoji is optional but helps signal it's a thread.",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.q3": "Should I number my thread posts?",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.a3": "It's common to use 1/X, 2/X format or just 🧵 on the first post. Our generator can include these indicators or you can add them yourself.",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.q4": "Do threads perform better than single posts?",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.a4": "Threads can perform very well for in-depth content - people share them as resources. But don't force everything into a thread. Sometimes a single skeet is all you need.",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.q5": "Can I edit thread posts after posting?",
    "blueskyThreadComposer.faq.a5": "Bluesky doesn't have native editing yet, so double-check before posting! Our generator gives you the full thread to review before you start posting.",
